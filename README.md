This Python script converts Persian subtitles into English subtitles by utilizing a provided list of translated English sentences. It reads the Persian subtitles from an SRT file and the English translations from a text file. The script then maps the sentences in the Persian subtitles to their respective blocks. Using this mapping, it distributes the English translations appropriately across these blocks. Finally, it generates a new SRT file containing the English subtitles with the corresponding timings. This tool is particularly useful for translating and synchronizing subtitles in videos when you have a separate list of translated sentences.
